But he was forced to play a fourth with Sinner having the serve to send it towards a decider at 2-1.\\\\nTo begin the fourth, Medvedev started brightly but Sinner held serve at 2-1 and Medvedev had the trainer come out to look at his right foot. He broke again at 5-1 to go to the brink of a two set lead, but Sinner grew into the match and prolonged the set as it looked suddenly like it could’ve gone back on serve but vitally, Medvedev saved break points and took his set point finally to go two up.\\'}]'}}}\n",
